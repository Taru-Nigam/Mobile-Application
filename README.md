# EcoTrack - README

## Overview
EcoTrack is a mobile application designed to help users monitor and reduce their carbon footprint. By allowing users to input their daily activities, such as distance traveled, energy consumption, and waste produced, EcoTrack calculates their carbon footprint and provides tips for reducing it. The app also includes goal-setting features to encourage users to make sustainable choices.

## Features
- **Carbon Footprint Calculator**: Users can input their metrics (distance traveled, energy used, waste produced) to calculate their carbon footprint.
- **Tips Page**: Provides users with daily tips on how to reduce their carbon footprint.
- **Goal Setting**: Users can set personal goals with specific metrics, descriptions, and deadlines.
- **Photo Upload**: Users can take or upload photos related to their goals.
- **Daily Tips Display**: A random tip is displayed on the main page each time the app is loaded.

## How It Works
1. **Input Metrics**: 
   - Users enter their daily metrics (distance traveled, energy consumed, waste produced) into the calculator.
   - The app uses a built-in formula to calculate the carbon footprint based on the input data.

2. **View Carbon Footprint**: 
   - The calculated carbon footprint is displayed on the main page.
   - The app updates the display automatically after each calculation without needing to restart.

3. **Set Goals**: 
   - Users can navigate to the goals page to set new goals.
   - Goals can be edited or deleted as needed.

4. **Achieve Goals**: 
   - Once a goal is achieved, users can click the "Goal Achieved" button to view their metrics and upload a photo.
   - Users can also navigate back to the goals page from this screen.

5. **Daily Tips**: 
   - Each time the app is opened, a new tip is displayed on the main page, randomly selected from a database of tips.

## Installation
To run EcoTrack on your device, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/EcoTrack.git

   ```
3. Open the project in your preferred IDE (e.g., Visual Studio).
4. Build and run the application on an Android emulator or a physical device.

## Troubleshooting
- If the app does not display updated metrics, ensure that you are entering new data correctly and that the app is refreshing the display.
- If you encounter issues with the goals page not displaying entries, try re-entering the page from the homepage.
